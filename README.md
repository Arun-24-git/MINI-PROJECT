Abstract

The AI-Based Postal Sorting System is a web-based simulation project designed to simulate automated postal letter and parcel sorting. It uses AI-based OCR technology and visual animation to demonstrate bin-wise classification based on PIN codes.This system is particularly useful for postal staff and sorting supervisors, helping them visualize how automation can reduce manual workload and improve operational efficiency. This system demonstrates a practical approach to postal automation, offering improved accuracy, reduced manual effort, and faster sorting. The project is implemented using Python, Flask, Tesseract OCR, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and
mysql, combining AI and web technologies to automate text extraction and simulate real-time parcel movement.The core functionality includes uploading or capturing images of postal items, extracting address text and PIN codes using OCR, mapping the items to predefined virtual bins, and displaying an animated simulation that mimics how modern postal machines physically sort items.Simulation is integrated solely to visualize and validate the logic, making the system suitable for real-world use in postal and logistics operations. By integrating AI-based OCR with postal sorting logic and visual animation, this project provides an efficient, realistic model for reducing manual effort and improving sorting speed.
